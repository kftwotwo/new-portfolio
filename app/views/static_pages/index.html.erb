    <p>Hello my name is Kevin Finley. I was raised on my family's farm. While working on the farm hard work and dedication was instilled in me at a young age. In middle and high school I had part time jobs. I moved to Portland from Montana for better job opportunities and to be close with my brother. His parterner recommend me to a local boot camp called Epicodus. I took the Ruby on Rail course.</p>
    <h1>My Journey</h1>

    <p>When I was in middle school everyone in my class had to do a science project. I wasn't interested in plants, animals, or chemicals. So I asked my middle school teacher for any suggestions. Unfortunately she would not give me any suggestions. During the lunch period I ran into the high school science teacher (which was my wrestling coach). He knew I like computers so he recommended a website filled with computer science topics for me. I saw this link called "Coding an Alphabetizer" and next to it, in bold said "HARD". I don't remember what the description was but the goal was for letters and words to be in alphabetical order</p>

    <p>My middle school teacher tried to discourage me from it. After three days of sweet talking, she gave me the okay. I had a month to work on this project. So the first two weeks was learning HTML and for my text editor I used Notepad on windows. Then for the remaining time I was learning JavaScript and CSS. Throughout the project I realized I had a interest in coding.</p>

    <p>When we presented our projects, my middle school teacher was amazed that I actually had a working application. So after explaining my code to three judges. I placed in third so that meant I got a blue ribbon then moved on state. After state I did not pursue coding trough middle and high school. But right after graduating high school I moved to Portland to attend to Epicodus!</p>
